# Rasvelg jobs

These jobs were migrated from twadoop repo in https://jira.twitter.biz/browse/AIPIPE-3041

Most are not owned by analytics but are running under the analytics role for legacy reasons until they are migrated to their proper job owners' service accounts.

ADP team will assign migration tickets to job owners, asking them to claim their jobs and redeploy them under their own service accounts. We expect these tickets to be completed by end of 2015Q3. At that time, any remaining jobs will be disabled and deleted. This work is tracked in https://jira.twitter.biz/browse/AIPIPE-2692

Migration instructions are available at http://go/rasvelgmigration
