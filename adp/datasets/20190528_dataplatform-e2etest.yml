# dataplatform-e2etest is a project jointly owned by CDL and ADP teams.
# This config is to register some of the top level directories that appear as unregistered.
# Marking all of the datasets as having NoPersonalData.
# The expectation here is that since these are system level log files (spark_logs), and
# test input/output files, they should not contain any personal data and hence safe to register
# with the CLI command.
