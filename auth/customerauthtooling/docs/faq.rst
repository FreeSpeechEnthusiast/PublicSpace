   **Frequently Asked Questions Guidelines**

   A Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) page is a well-known format for documenting common customer questions. FAQs can be a useful tool for deflecting customer questions, especially if you link to them in your Slack channel. However, in general, the TechDocs team does not recommend teams use FAQs for documentation. This is because FAQs tend to become a dumping ground for unstructured, miscellaneous information and therefore do not scale well. 

   Ideally, any information that you would include in a FAQ should be in another page in your documentation, where a reader is more likely to naturally discover it. If this page or content does not exist, this means you have a gap in your documentation and you should add this information. For example, common customer issues usually belong in a Troubleshooting Guide. If you have great information architecture, you do not need a FAQ.

   If you do use a FAQ, ensure you do the following: 

   + Link to other pages instead of writing content to avoid duplication
   + Do not include procedural information
   + Update the page regularly 
   + If your FAQ has more than five questions, logically group them into categories. 
   + Avoid including more than 15 questions
