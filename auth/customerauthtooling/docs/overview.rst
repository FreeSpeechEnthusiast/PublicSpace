   **Conceptual Overview Guidelines**

   A conceptual overview provides users with a high-level understanding of a system’s overall purpose and design.

   Do not assume a reader's level of expertise. Write for a beginner audience. Link to external resources to explain complex topics. 
   Do not reference complex concepts before defining them. If you must, mention that the concept will be covered in more detail later. 

   Overviews are aimed at: 

   * Users who want to dive deeper into the "why" and "how" of your product
   * Beginners who do not know where to start
   * Developers that want to extend your product 

   When thinking about your audience, consider the following questions: 

   * How familiar is the reader with the broader domain of the product? For example, machine learning for Cortex or containers for Docker and Kubernetes.
   * What assumptions might they already have about your product domain? 
   * How did you get up to speed with the product? What confused you while you were learning?

Overview
--------

.. admonition:: ∆ Template Instructions
  :class: template

  **In this section:**
  
  * Briefly describe the problem your product is trying to solve and how the product solves it.
  * Summarize the basic information needed to understand this product. 
  * Explain how your product fits into the larger picture. 
  * Provide links to concepts that a reader might be unfamiliar with.
  
  This is not a design doc and implementation detail should be kept to a minimum. Instead, add links to design docs.

Benefits
--------

.. admonition:: ∆ Template Instructions

  In this section, list the benefits of using your product. If applicable, mention similar existing products and explain why your product is different. How did things work before your product existed? Use the below template table to compare different products.

**∆** *Product* **∆** has the following benefits:

- **∆ Benefit:** *Description of benefit* **∆**

Architectural Design
--------------------

.. admonition:: ∆ Template Instructions
  :class: template

  In this section, explain the relationship between your product's components. Include diagrams. Abstract implementation details in your explanation and only provide a high-level understanding. If you find yourself getting into deep detail, you are probably over-explaining.
  
  For guidelines for creating diagrams, see `Creating Diagrams <https://docbird.twitter.biz/techdocs_style_guide/diagrams.html>`_


Terminology
-----------

.. admonition:: ∆ Template Instructions
  :class: template

  In this section, define terms that are unique to your product. Link to this section on other pages where you mention the terms. Use the following template glossary directive. For information about glossary directives, see `Glossary <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html?#glossary>`_ in the Sphinx documentation.
