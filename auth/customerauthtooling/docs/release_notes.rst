   **Release Note Guidelines**

   Release notes include information about new features and known issues. Because many services at Twitter are not versioned, release notes are organized by features rather than individual components or version numbers. 

   For every feature and known issue, include links to supporting documentation with procedures. Do not include procedures in release notes because it is harder to discover tasks in release notes compared to a dedicated page.    

   **Template Resources**
