THESE ARE PUBLIC "PRIVATE" KEYS

These keys are meant to be used while running your services locally, without the need to rely on
TSS to retrieve actual production private keys.

These keys will not allow you to access production data.

The format of the directory is:

- private_keys
|-- pasetoheaders  (root relative folder)
  |-- environment  (ex: devel)
    |-- issuer     (ex: tfe)
    |-- issuer    (ex: anotherService)
