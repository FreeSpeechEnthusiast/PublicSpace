Conceptual Overview
===================

**∆** A conceptual overview should provide readers with a high-level understanding of a system’s overall purpose, principles, and design.

**∆** Overviews are aimed at:

* Motivated learners
* Users who want to dive deeper into the "why" and "how" of your product
* Beginners who don't know where else to start

**∆** When thinking about your audience, consider the following questions:

* How familiar is your reader with the broader domain of my product? (E.g., machine learning for Cortex or containers for Docker/Kubernetes.)
* What sort of analogies are likely to resonate with your readers? What sorts of mental models might they already have in place around your product domain?
* How did you get up to speed with the product? What confused you while you were learning?

Introduction
------------

**∆** This section should describe the problem your product is trying to solve, and a little history behind how your product came to be. (If necessary, this history can be a section of its own.)


Basic Understandings
--------------------

**∆** *Summarize the basic information needed to understand this product and overview. Don't make assumptions about a reader's level of expertise. Reviewing the basics is useful for anyone, even experts. For anything you really don’t want to explain, link to external resources. (Perhaps the ones you used to first learn about the topic!)*

*Be wary of referencing complex concepts before you've defined them. If you must, assure the reader that the concept in question will be covered in more detail later.*

Purpose
-------

**∆** *Explain how your product fits into the larger picture. What is the problem domain? Do similar products exist, and if so, why is yours different? How did things work before your product existed? (A lot of this content probably already exists in your design doc, but don't forget this is NOT a design doc and implementation detail should be kept to a minimum.)*


Principles
----------

**∆** *What are the essential principles behind your product/solution? Use examples and analogies. Abstract concepts are hard for newbies to grasp. People understand best with concrete examples or by analogy to things they’re already familiar with. You can assume your reader will be relatively patient. Unlike most types of documentation, a reader of a conceptual overview is more likely to take some time to read the document from start to finish.*

Design
------

**∆** *Provide a mental model – with diagrams. The conceptual overview is essentially a way for you to MIND CONTROL your readers. You get to define the mental model they will use to think about your product; visual representations are a great tool to help you do this effectively.*

*A conceptual overview is not a design doc. Design docs are written with a sophisticated technical audience in mind; they often omit important contextual information or go into unnecessary detail on conceptually unimportant topics. Furthermore, an overview is a living document that should reflect the current state of affairs, whereas a design doc is frozen in time once it has been accepted by its approver(s).*

*A conceptual overview is not a masterclass. If you find yourself getting into deep detail, you’re probably over-explaining. Alternately, there may be a deeper issue with the underlying mental model, or even the product itself.*

Conclusion
----------

**∆** *Always have some kind of explicit conclusion. The conclusion is where you can point your readers towards next steps, such as a quickstart guide or API documentation.*
